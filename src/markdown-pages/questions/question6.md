#### 2 major challenges around DNS configuration

I think understanding DNS and why it exists is relatively simple. However, the steps to configure it can be quite misleading for a non-technical person.
The two major challenges in my opinion are:

1. Things like CNAME and A records must sound strange. All these nomenclatures and the need to configure them on the registrar can be a pain for the non-technical person.
2. With the widespread of IPV6, understanding the differences between it and IPv4 can also be challenging.
