#### Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?

HTTPS allows for secure communications between two endpoints, client and server. SSL/TLS helps by encrypting the data being sent and making sure only the client and server can decrypt it.

Three reasons why this is important are:

1. This is important because without it an attacker can listen to the traffic and understand the flow of data being transported between the two.
2. It also allows a brand to increase its trustiness. With a valid SSL certificate, we know that is (apparently) a legitimate business.
3. An attacker can also impersonate the request, mislead both server and client which can cause damage.
