#### What did you think of our service during the time you used it?

I think it's an amazing platform that makes it easy for a person to publish their website. The drag and drop feature, step-by-step Getting Started and intuitive UI are the most interesting features in my opinion.

I also enjoyed browsing through your documentation. I believe it is well structured, almost like telling a story through it, with step-by-step guidelines on how to build and deploy with Netlify.
