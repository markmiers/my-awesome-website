#### Vulnerability Report

First I'm going to assume the reporter sent this through your Hackerone program:

https://hackerone.com/netlify

If the report was not clear already I would ask for video evidence (always helps on these reports) to corroborate the security breach.

At most, we need to have the following details to be able to take the next steps:

- Asset affected
- Weakness ([OWASP's top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) provides a list of the 10 top Web Application Security Risks)
- Severity (this is not mandatory but certainly helps us understand the priority.)
- Proof of concept

On the Proof of Concept, it is always important to have:

- Summary
- Step-by-Step instructions on how to replicate
- Attack Surface
- Impact
- Recommended Actions

Having in mind this information, depending on the severity and weakness I would escalate to the appropriate team.
